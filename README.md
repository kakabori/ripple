ripple_LAXS.py is the main file. The required packages are

- numpy http://www.numpy.org
- matplotlib http://www.matplotlib.org
- lmfit http://cars9.uchicago.edu/software/python/lmfit/

To do:

- Need to grab chi squared from fit.
- Check to make sure fit should be done with |F| not I=|F|^2
- Incorporate get_phase in Fourier_decomp => create a new function?
- Should play with max iteration. Doesn't seem like fit converged.
- Implement SGF
- Implement S1G
